Basic step JDBC :-
Step 1:-
Class.forName("Com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
// to load the Driver class to establish database connection

Step 2:-
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/database","Username","password");
// attempts to establish a connection to the database by using the given database URL

Step 3:- Create the Statement object
Statement stm = con.createStatement();
// the object statement is responsible to execute Queries with the database

Step 4:- execute the Query 
Result rs = stm.executeQuery("Select * from table_name");
// the executeQuery() method of statement interface is used execute query to the database.
/* When it comes to extracting data, then executeQuery method will be used. And when it comes 
to making any kind of modification i.e. insert, update, delete, then executeUpdate method will be used.*/

Step 5:- close the connection object 
// By closing connection object statement and ResultSet will be close automatically
